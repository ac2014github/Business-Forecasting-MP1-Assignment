# I am confident with these forecasts because Naive is just a benchmark and a baseline for my Exponential Smoothing and HoltsWinters forecasts. The latter 2 forecasts are the ones that have the lowest RMSEs compared to the other models when measuring accuracy. Both of them are taking into consideration the seasonal trend that is evident from the Acf.
